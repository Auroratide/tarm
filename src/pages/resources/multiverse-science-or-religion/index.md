The <dfn>universe</dfn> includes everything we know: space, galaxies, stars, earth, you, and me. Some scientists postulate the existence of a <dfn>multiverse</dfn>, many other universes. However, just because some scientists publish papers and books about a hypothetical multiverse does not mean it's real, nor does it mean it is even science.

There are different ideas for how a multiverse might work:

* **Many Worlds**: Usually, when we make a decision, only one of those decisions happen. What if they both happened instead, with one result being one universe and the other being a new universe? Turns out this is one way to interpret how quantum mechanics works.
* **Eternal Inflation**: Our universe is thought to have started as a very tiny patch of space that has since expanded into everything we know (called the <dfn>Big Bang</dfn>). What if that same thing happens in other parts of _all_ of space, beyond our universe's boundaries? Those would be universes in their own right, possibly similar to ours.
* And there are others.

## Why Multiverse is not a Science

Ultimately, most (if not all) multiverse ideas have the simple problem that the other universes cannot be observed. There is no way you can observe a universe where you made a different decision; there is no way to look beyond the edge of our universe to see if other universes are out there.

Because nothing about the multiverse can be observed, you can't test if one exists or not. And if you can't test it, the theory is not **[falsifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability)**; science cannot say anything about the truth or falsity of the theory.

* It is a **pseudoscience** if people publish ideas about it as if it were a science.
* It is a **religion** if you choose to believe or disbelieve it, but don't claim your decision is based in science.
