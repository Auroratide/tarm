Dr. Tim Lomas, a psychology researcher, started something called the [Positive Lexicography Project](https://www.drtimlomas.com/lexicography/cm4mi) with the goal of finding precise words for various positive emotions in non-English languages that English itself lacks. Examples include:

<ul>
  <li><strong><i lang="pt">Desbundar</i></strong> (Portuguese) - letting everything go when having fun</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="ar">Tarab</i></strong> (Arabic) - a musically induced trance</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="jp">Shinrin-yoku</i></strong> (Japanese) - relaxation in a forest (potentially figuratively)</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="tl">Gigil</i></strong> (Filipino) - the desire to pinch or squeeze someone because they are cherished</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="zh">Yuan bei</i></strong> (Chinese) - a sense of perfect accomplishment</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="iu">Iktsuarpok</i></strong> (Inuktitut) - when you continuously check for someone's arrival in anticipation</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="jp">Natsukashii</i></strong> (Japanese) - nostalgia for a fond memory, with sadness it is past</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="jp">Wabi-sabi</i></strong> (Japanese) - an exaltation of transience and imperfection in beauty</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="pt">Saudade</i></strong> (Portuguese) - a deep longing for something that may never exist</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="de">Sehnsucht</i></strong> (German) - a desire for alternative (possibly unattainable) kinds of life</li>
  <li><strong><i>Dadirri</i></strong> (Ngangiwumirr) - deeply reflective listening</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="hu">Pihentagyú</i></strong> (Hungarian) - having a state of mind for creating sophisticated jokes and solutions on the fly</li>
  <li><strong><i lang="sa">Sukha</i></strong> (Sanskrit) - genuine lasting happiness independent of circumstance</li>
</ul>

<p>Embedded in a language is a culture's state of mind: the words people invent encapsulate the ideas that are most important to those people. Lomas believes identifying precise words for complex emotions can help <q>articulate whole areas of experience we’ve only dimly noticed</q>.</p>
