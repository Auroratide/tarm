Estimating the completion of a software product tends to be futile; it's at least very hard to do well, and at worst actively harmful for the team.

Factors that make estimation difficult:

* Every product hopes to accomplish something that hasn't been done before, so you can't rely on past experience all the time.
* Unknown unknowns do not surface until implementation time and can really only be accounted for with padding.
* Complexity that arises from interdependencies becomes exponentially greater the larger a piece of software.

Reasons estimation may be harmful:

* Estimation creates dates that attempt to create accountability, rather than building a relationship on trust.
* Underestimating leads to compromises in the health of a project, such as increasing tech debt.
* Overestimating can make a project seem less valuable than it actually is.
* The act of estimation slows progress down as developers are incentivized to over-analyze to create accurate estimations.

Instead, **estimation should be about relative effort rather than absolute cost**. That is, there is value in the team collectively understanding the complexity of tasks relative to each other, mostly to ensure a shared understanding.
