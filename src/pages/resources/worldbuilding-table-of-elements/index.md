Worldbuilding is complicated because worlds are complicated. It is often to name every facet of our world. Perhaps we can think of high-level ideas like environment, people, culture, architecture, government, and so on. But those break down further into finer categories, and there may be essential categories we just miss because we take for granted.

Worldbuilding is actually _harder_ because its facets are a superset of our world's; in a fictional world, you can have things like magic, for example.

This Worldbuilding Table of Elements does a great job listing at least 118 facets to consider. Some of the elements I found illuminating were:

* Taboos
* Heraldy
* Lies & Propaganda
* Disease
* Slang & Curses
* Deathcare
