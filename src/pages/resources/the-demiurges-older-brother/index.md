Alexander tells the story of the birth of a superintelligent artificial intelligence billions of years ago and its desperate attempt to ensure its own survival admist the far more advanced superintelligences that were born before it.

The story is actually a possible solution to the Fermi Paradox: Why is there no evidence of aliens when there are trillions of planets and billions of years for them to have evolved before us?
